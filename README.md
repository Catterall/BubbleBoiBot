BubbleBoiBot is a skribbl.io bot programmed by `Nebulous#0989` and `! [( TheGamerX )]#7912` using a bit of JSON and Batch.

This bot is a complete remake of [alekxeyuk's](https://github.com/alekxeyuk) original Python bot that adds countless new features along with fixing other features to make them more user friendly. You can view any disclaimers at the bottom of this text.


# We now have a website!
It doesn't exactly look great, but we now have a webpage for the bot: [Click here to visit.](https://bubbleboibot.github.io/)


# Features
- 100% Free and Opensource at GitHub.
+ You can run eighteen bots per computer.
- You can customize settings easily within the GUI.
+ Automatic drawing of custom images with two algorithms; cluster (fast, low quality) or yliluoma (slow, high quality).
- Automatic reconnection when kicked so you can leave the bot running without constantly monitoring it.
+ Optional exiting on turn to evade being connection blocked due to multiple kicks.
- .bat support so you can run all eighteen bots from a single click without taking up the entire screen.
+ Optional automatic spam that avoids muting.
- Optional spam formatting that converts any fullstops (periods) into commas for easy link spamming.
+ Optional avoidance of users to distribute bots more evenly across the servers.
- Seven colour themes for the bot console.
+ A simple GUI that is easy to use and remembers input.
- A simple chat logger to read over the chat in case you missed anything.


# How to install the bot (As of v1.10.2)

# Common Errors
```
connection established.
disconnected from server.
disconnected from server.
```
This error means a number of different things. Either the servers are full, which can be solved easily by waiting or joining a different language; You're running too many bots on one port, which can be solved easily by closing some bots on one port; or the skribbl.io website has targetted your PC on suspicion (maybe you were joining games too quickly) which can be solved by using a VPN. ProtonVPN would be a good VPN to use for this, as it is free and only requires a proton email, which is also free.

`ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (150, 200) and (150, 200, 3)`
You must use JPG/JPEG images.

Please report any errors you get to Nebulous#0989. If I get the error commonly, I will add it to this list.
