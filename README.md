# BubbleBoiBot
This bot is a remake of a bot created by alekxeyuk that adds an easier command line interfact, the ability to easily run eighteen bots at the same time and adds an easier spam configuration.
# How to install the bot:
1. Download Python 3.7.4 here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4.exe

2. When installing Python 3.7.4, check the, "Install to PATH", checkbox then click, "Custom installation". Check every box and leave the default save location as default (Do not click browse!)

3. On this GitHub page, click the green, "Clone or download." Buton and then click, "Download as ZIP." Then, extract the ZIP file somewhere on your computer. You will need to come to this file to run the bot, so save it somewhere rememerable.

4. Install GIT here: https://git-scm.com/download/win                                                                                      When installing GIT, just click, "Next" until you reach the, "Install" button and click it.
5. Do `windows + s` and type in the search, "Windows power shell". Right click it and then click, "Run as administrator."
6. In the windows shell, enter the following command:
```
pip install websockets aiohttp python-socketio requests git+https://www.github.com/hbldh/hitherdither Pillow google_images_download numpy
```
7. To run the bot, head to the BubblyBoiBot folder (not the ZIP, the folder you extracted) and click the `loopAll.bat` file.
