### Notice: This bot is patched - it has been moved to my new main account and will remain archived.


BubbleBoiBot is a skribbl.io bot programmed using Python.

This bot is a complete remake of [alekxeyuk's](https://github.com/alekxeyuk) original Python bot that adds countless new features - along with fixing other features to make them more user friendly. You can view any disclaimers at the bottom of this text.


# Features
- 100% Free and Opensource at GitHub.
+ You can run eighteen bots per computer.
- You can customize settings easily within the GUI.
+ Automatic drawing of custom images with two algorithms; cluster (fast, low quality) or yliluoma (slow, high quality).
- Automatic reconnection when kicked so you can leave the bot running without constantly monitoring it.
- .bat support so you can run all eighteen bots from a single click without taking up the entire screen.
- Optional automatic spam that avoids muting.
- Optional spam formatting that converts any fullstops (periods) into commas for easy link spamming.
+ Optional avoidance of users to distribute bots more evenly across the servers.
- Seven colour themes for the bot console.
+ A simple GUI that is easy to use and remembers input.
- A simple chat logger to read over the chat in case you missed anything.


# How to install the bot
- Download Python 3.7.4 32bit or 64bit here (Make sure to choose the right one for your device): 

  - 32-bit: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4.exe

  - 64-bit: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-amd64.exe

- When installing Python 3.7.4, check the, "Install to PATH", checkbox then click, "Custom installation". Check every box and leave the default save location as default (Do not click browse!) (For those wondering, you must install to all users to get pythonw.exe)

- Download the bot at the releases tab: https://github.com/TheLoveableBananaNoodle/BubbleBoiBot/releases.

- To run the bot, go to the BubbleBoiBot folder and click the `launcher.bat` file to run the GUI.

  - All files in the `images` folder must be images.
  - Image names are case and symbol sensitive and you must include the extension (e.g BubbleBoiBotLogo.jpg).
  - Images must be JPG/JPEG/BMP.


# How to use the bot.
Simply run the GUI and enter the desired settings to run the bot. From there, keep the application running. To close the bot, right click the application's icon in the task bar and click "Close all windows" to quickly close all the instances of the bot running.


# Common Errors
```
connection established.
disconnected from server.
disconnected from server.
```
This error means a number of different things. Either the servers are full, which can be solved easily by waiting or joining a different language; You're running too many bots on one port, which can be solved easily by closing some bots on one port; or the skribbl.io website has targetted your PC on suspicion (maybe you were joining games too quickly) which can be solved by using a VPN. ProtonVPN would be a good VPN to use for this, as it is free and only requires a proton email, which is also free.

`ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (150, 200) and (150, 200, 3)`
You must use JPG/JPEG images.
