# BubbleBoiBot v1.8
This bot is a complete remake of alekxeyuk's original Python bot that adds countless new features along with fixing other features to make them more user friendly. You can view any disclaimers at the bottom of this text.


# Features:
- 100% Free and Opensource at GitHub.
+ You can run eighteen bots per computer.
- You can customize settings easily within the GUI.
+ Automatic drawing of custom images with two algorithms; cluster (fast, low quality) or yliluoma (slow, high quality).
- Automatic reconnection when kicked so you can leave the bot running without constantly monitoring it.
+ .bat support so you can run all eighteen bots from a single click without taking up the entire screen.
- Optional automatic spam that avoids muting.
+ Optional spam formatting that converts any fullstops (periods) into commas for easy link spamming.
- Optional automatic searching for users (Use a VPN to stop skribbl.io stopping your connections!).
+ Seven colour themes for the bot console.
- A simple GUI that is easy to use and remembers input.


# How to install the bot:
1. Download Python 3.7.4 here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4.exe

2. When installing Python 3.7.4, check the, "Install to PATH", checkbox then click, "Custom installation". Check every box and leave the default save location as default (Do not click browse!)

3. Download the bot at the releases tab: https://github.com/TheLoveableBananaNoodle/BubbleBoiBot/releases.

4. Do `windows + s` and type in the search, "Windows power shell". Right click it and then click, "Run as administrator."

5. In the windows shell, enter the following command:
```
pip install websockets aiohttp python-socketio requests Pillow numpy commentjson colorama pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
```
6. To run the bot, head to the BubbleBoiBot folder (Not the ZIP!) and click the `BubbleBoiBot v1.8 Launcher` file.

All files in the `images` folder must be images.
Image names are case and symbol sensitive and you must include the extension and images folder (e.g images\BubbleBoiBotLogo.jpg).
Images must be JPG/JPEG/BMP.


# Thank you for installing the bot!

# Common Errors:
```
connection established.
disconnected from server.
disconnected from server.
```
This error means a number of different things. Either the servers are full, which can be solved easily by waiting or joining a different language; You're running too many bots on one port, which can be solved easily by closing some bots on one port; or the skribbl.io website has targetted your PC on suspicion (this happens a lot when you use the bot to search for users) which can be solved by using a VPN. ProtonVPN would be a good VPN to use for this.

`ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (150, 200) and (150, 200, 3)` You must use JPG/JPEG images.

Please report any errors you get to Catterall#6723. If I get the error commonly, I will add it to this list.
